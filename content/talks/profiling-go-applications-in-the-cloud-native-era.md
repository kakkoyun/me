title: "talk: Profiling Go Applications in the Cloud-Native Era"
---

For years Google has consistently been able to cut down multiple percentage points in their fleet-wide resource usage every quarter, using techniques described in their “Google-Wide Profiling” paper. Ad-hoc profiling has long been part of the developer’s toolbox to analyze the CPU and memory usage of a running process. However, through continuous profiling, and the systematic collection of profiles, entirely new workflows suddenly become possible.

The presenter will start this talk with an introduction to profiling applications, and demonstrate how one can practice it using open-source continuous profiling tools, and how continuous profiling allows for an unprecedented fleet-wide understanding of code at production runtime.

Attendees will learn how to continuously profile their code, guide themselves in building robust, reliable, and performant software and reduce cloud spending systematically.

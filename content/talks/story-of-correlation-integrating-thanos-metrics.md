title: "talk: Story of Correlation - Integrating Thanos Metrics with Observability Signals"
---

The CNCF Incubated Thanos project with the large open-source community continues to push boundaries regarding observability and monitoring using Prometheus-based metrics. Together with the Prometheus community, it improves the metric story for Kubernetes clusters and beyond. Things like improved performance, better scalability, debuggability, security, metrics backfilling and query QoS is only the tip of the iceberg. As we know, observability nowadays comes in many flavours. Bunching them together is not a trivial side, given many shapes and collection points. Aside from metrics, we have logs, traces or even continuous profiling. In this talk, Kemal and Bartek, Thanos maintainers, after a quick overview of Thanos, will explain how Thanos can be integrated with those non-metric observability signals. The audience will learn an example, end-to-end ways to correlate multiple observability backends with Thanos for enhanced observability and monitoring experience.

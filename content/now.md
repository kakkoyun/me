What I'm focused on now. Learn more about the Now page idea at <https://sive.rs/now>.

## Work

Building Go-for-Go at Datadog APM: compile-time and runtime instrumentation, profiling, and performance tooling for Go services.

Currently focused on Go runtime and compiler internals, building AST manipulation tools for injecting instrumentation systems. This work spans OpenTelemetry Go compile instrumentation, Datadog Orchestrion, and dd-trace-go (see [Open Source](/open_source/) for details).

## Learning & Exploration

Focused on writing, blogging, engineering leadership, and the internals of LLMs. Exploring how these tools work under the hood and how to build better systems with them.

Experimenting with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and MCPs to fully automate my Personal Knowledge Management on top of Obsidian.

## Hobby Tech

Showing some love to my Raspberry Pi cluster and Flipper Zero. Small projects, big fun.

## Family & Life

Based in Berlin with my partner and our son.

Gravel cycling whenever I can. Dreaming of camping and bikepacking tripsâ€”something I want to do with my boy when he's grown up enough. For now, prioritizing outdoor time and sleep.

## Reading & Writing

Reading a mix of systems papers, engineering leadership books, and sci-fi. Check my [reading page](/reading/) for current books. Notes and insights land in the [Notes](/notes/) section when useful.

## Reading Preferences

I tend to gravitate toward:

- Systems programming and performance engineering
- Science fiction and fantasy
- Technical deep-dives and research papers
- Philosophy and human behavior
- Distributed systems and databases

I track everything on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kakkoyun) and occasionally share notes on interesting reads in the [Notes](/notes/) section of this site.

If you have recommendations, especially in systems engineering or sci-fi, [reach out](/misc/)!

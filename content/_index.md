## Hey, I'm Kemal

Software Infrastructure Engineer, System Programmer, Performance Engineer. Obsessed with observability, instrumentation, and low-level programming. Slow thinker. Open Source Enthusiast. Mentor. Blogger and speaker. Introverted human (not Cylon, I guess). Pronouns: He/Him.

Deep in the trenches of Go compile-time magic, runtime eBPF trickery, and tracing wizardry. Keeping a soft spot for profiling while tinkering with Go and its toolchain. Still exploring distributed systems, time-series (Prometheus) sorcery, and making machines sing in harmony.

Currently building Go instrumentation and tracing while keeping an eye on profiling at Datadog. Based in Berlin with my partner and our son.

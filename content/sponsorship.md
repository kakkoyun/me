I’m working toward spending more time building open‑source tooling for observability, instrumentation, and performance engineering.

Your support helps me:

- Dedicate time to maintainers’ work and triage
- Prototype new tooling (profilers, compile‑time instrumentation, eBPF experiments)
- Write posts/talks and share repeatable techniques

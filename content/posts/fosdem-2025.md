### Another Year, Another FOSDEM

**FOSDEM**â€”the annual pilgrimage to **Brussels** for a weekend of open-source brilliance, hallway track magic, and the inevitable sleep deprivation. This year's **Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting** was, as always, a whirlwind of ideas, people, and tech so bleeding-edge it practically needed bandages.

But for me? It was all about **seeing friends**. Catching up, syncing, and squeezing in as many conversations as humanly possible. As we always sayâ€”the **hallway track is the real conference**. I'm beyond grateful for the people I managed to see, and equally bummed about those I missed. But with a toddler waiting at home, even carving out this limited time was a logistical miracle.

### Saturday: Go, Go, Go... and the eBPF Black Hole

Saturday kicked off with a deep dive into the **Go DevRoom**, before a (failed) mission to infiltrate the **eBPF** talks.

#### **Go Goodness**

The **Go DevRoom** delivered as expected:

- **"[The State of Go](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/go_state/)"** â€“ Maartje Eyskens gave a solid rundown on where Go is headed.
- **"[Swiss Maps in Go](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/go_swiss_maps/)"** â€“ Bryan Boreham took us through these lightning-fast maps.

- **"[Go-ing Easy on Memory: Writing GC-Friendly Code](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/go_gc_friendly/)"** â€“ SÃ¼mer Cipâ€™s talk was a timely reminder that, yes, your garbage collection problems are (probably) your fault.

#### **eBPF Fail**

The **eBPF DevRoom**? Packed. Absolutely impenetrable. As someone put it on Twitter:

> "Nobody leaves #eBPF room at #FOSDEM, so nobody gets in. ðŸ¥²"

Next year, I'm bringing a tent and camping outside the door.

### Sunday: Monitoring, Metrics, and Maybe Too Many Frites

Sunday was all about observability, performance, and squeezing every bit of insight from running systems.

#### **Observability Overload**

The **Monitoring and Observability DevRoom** had a strong lineup:

- Richard "RichiH" Hartmann set the stage.
- **"[The Performance Impact of Auto-Instrumentation](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/monitor_auto_instrumentation/)"** â€“ James Belchamber gave a fantastic talk on the hidden costs of auto-instrumentation.
- **"[Prometheus Version 3](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/monitor_prometheus_v3/)"** â€“ Jan Fajerski and Bryan Boreham gave us the lowdown on whatâ€™s next for Prometheus.

### Community Vibes

Like I saidâ€”**FOSDEM** is really about the people. The talks are great, but the real magic happens in the hallway track. Some of the best conversations werenâ€™t planned; they just happened over coffee, between sessions, or during a frantic sprint between buildings.

Iâ€™m incredibly happy for the folks I got to see, and at the same time, I wish I had more time to catch up with everyone I missed. But life is about balance, and with a little one waiting at home, I had to make every moment count.

Oh, and the **frites**? Still undefeated.

### Bonus: Trains, Chaos, and a Race Against Time

Because no trip is complete without **public transport drama**, my journey back home came with an extra dose of stress. Trains? Cancelled. Schedule? A mess. Plane? Hanging by a thread.

Somehow, I made it. But FOSDEM weekend wouldnâ€™t be complete without at least one unexpected adventure.

### Final Thoughts

**FOSDEM 2025** delivered. Again. Already looking forward to next year. If you're into open source and havenâ€™t experienced **FOSDEM**, sort it out.

At the beginning of the last year (2019), I promised myself that I would contribute more to the Free and Open source software world, in any form or shape (like start a blog perhaps). To do that, _and of course, for my mundane needs as well,_ I started working on a small project called [drone-cache](https://github.com/meltwater/drone-cache). While I was working on that project, I also wanted to give a try to my long awaiting hobby-to-be _blogging_. So I managed to write [my first ever blog post](https://kakkoyun.github.io/2019/04/10/making-drone-builds-10-times-faster/), where I told the story of how I built the drone-cache.

I enjoyed it, and I thought it would become a habit for me. With regret, I couldn't make it happen. (If I have ever given myself a dime for the promises that I had made.) You know why? Life happened! I decided to change jobs and find one that would challenge me more. _(As the wiser always say, be careful what you wish for!)_ Long story short, after searching for a job for a couple of months, _the job_ found me! But even the searching part had taken a considerable amount of time and energy.

Last July, I started my journey at Red Hat, Openshift Observability Platform team. Since then, I have learned a ton! Still learning, pushing forward, and challenging myself in every possible way, and enjoying every bit of it. But it hurts! I guess this is better than whining; you know what they say...

In this constant masochistic self-pushing journey, I also decided to overcome one of my colossal fears: _public speaking._ With the help of amazing Bartek Plotka ([@bwplotka](https://twitter.com/bwplotka)), I gave my first talk on building observable services/applications with Go at [GoDays 2020 Berlin](https://youtu.be/LU6D5cNeHks) and [FOSDEM 2020](https://video.fosdem.org/2020/UD2.120/testing_observability.mp4)! For further details, check: "[Are you testing your Observability?](https://github.com/kakkoyun/are-you-testing-your-observability)". _(Maybe I should write a series where I delve into details of the points that we have listed in the talk. ðŸ¤”)_

### What's next?

Precisely at this point of time and space, in the known universe, I would like to challenge myself a bit more and try harder to keep my promise to be a more frequent blogger. I am going to start blogging about the concepts that I have been working on, such as building observable distributed systems, building high-performance Go applications and more. While I'm exploring and learning about these topics, I'd like to share my experience and reach out to people (if somebody reads this out there). I will give more real-life examples, challenge the ideas more and try to come up with some good practices and share my modest implications! So stay tuned!

## Headline

Support independent open-source work in observability and performance.

## Description

I have a dream: to be a full-time family man, fully financially independent, doing what I loveâ€”mostly open-source work. I'm not there yet, but I'm working toward it.

One-time support goes toward maintaining open-source projects, writing practical guides, and experimenting with better tooling for instrumentation and profiling. Every contribution helps me dedicate more time to work that benefits the community.

## About me

Performance and observability engineer at Datadog, working on Go instrumentation and profiling. I maintain and contribute to open-source projects in the CNCF ecosystem and share what I learn through talks and writing. Based in Berlin with my family.

## What I'm creating

- Open-source tooling and examples for observability and performance
- Practical write-ups on instrumentation, profiling, and systems engineering
- Deep-dive posts and talks that help engineers build better systems
- Experiments with eBPF, Go toolchain, and profiling techniques

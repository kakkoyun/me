## Headline

Back independent open-source work in observability and performance.

## Description

I have a dream: to be a full-time family man, fully financially independent, doing what I loveâ€”mostly open-source work. I'm not there yet, but I'm working toward it.

Your monthly support helps me invest steady time into open-source instrumentation and profiling projects, publish practical guides, and explore new techniques (including eBPF) that benefit the community. Every bit brings me closer to dedicating more time to open-source work.

## About me

Performance and observability engineer at Datadog, working on Go instrumentation and profiling. I maintain and contribute to projects across the CNCF ecosystem (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and more). I share what I learn through talks, writing, and open-source contributions. Based in Berlin with my family.

## What I'm creating

- Hands-on write-ups on instrumentation, profiling, and performance
- Open-source tooling and examples for building observable, reliable Go services
- Deep-dive posts and practical techniques
- Experiments and prototypes that push the ecosystem forward (eBPF, Go toolchain, profiling)

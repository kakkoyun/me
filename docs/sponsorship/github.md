## Headline

Supporting open-source observability and performance engineering.

## Description

I have a dream: to be a full-time family man, fully financially independent, doing what I loveâ€”mostly open-source work. I'm not there yet, but I'm working toward it.

Your sponsorship helps me maintain critical open-source projects, write deep-dive posts about instrumentation and profiling, and prototype new tooling that the community can use. I build tools and techniques for understanding production systems: Go instrumentation, profiling, and eBPF-powered observability.

## About me

Performance and observability engineer at Datadog, working on Go instrumentation and profiling. I maintain and contribute to open-source projects across the CNCF ecosystem (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and more). Speaker, writer, and long-time tinkerer based in Berlin with my family.

## What I'm creating

- Reusable instrumentation patterns and profiling examples
- Open-source tooling for observability and performance
- Deep-dive posts and talks on systems engineering
- Experiments and prototypes (eBPF, Go toolchain, profiling)
- Write-ups that make it easier to build and operate reliable, fast software

## Headline

Fuel open-source observability and performance engineering work.

## Description

I have a dream: to be a full-time family man, fully financially independent, doing what I loveâ€”mostly open-source work. I'm not there yet, but I'm working toward it.

Your support helps me carve out time to maintain open-source projects, write actionable posts about instrumentation and profiling, and share insights from building reliable Go systems.

## About me

Performance and observability engineer at Datadog, working on Go instrumentation and profiling. I maintain and contribute to open-source projects across the CNCF ecosystem and share what I learn through talks and writing. Based in Berlin with my family.

## What I'm creating

- Practical guides on instrumentation, profiling, and performance engineering
- Open-source tooling and examples (eBPF, Go, observability)
- Deep-dive posts and talks that help engineers build better systems
- Experiments and prototypes that push the ecosystem forward

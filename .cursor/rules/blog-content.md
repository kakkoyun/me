# Blog Content Creation Guidelines

## Content Types and Structure

### Technical Findings
```yaml
---
title: "How I Accidentally DDoS'd My Own Service ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
type: "posts"
categories: ["technical-findings"]
tags: ["lessons-learned", "debugging"]
description: "A tale of hubris, misconfiguration, and eventual enlightenment"
toc: true
---
```

- Start with the problem statement (make it relatable)
- Include relevant code snippets or system diagrams
- Add "Plot twist" sections for unexpected findings
- End with lessons learned (and maybe self-deprecating humor)

### Tutorials
```yaml
---
title: "Surviving Kubernetes: A Guide for the Perpetually Confused üéØ"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
type: "posts"
categories: ["tutorials"]
tags: ["kubernetes", "guide"]
description: "Because everyone pretends to understand Kubernetes, but we know better"
toc: true
difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
---
```

- Start with a funny analogy comparing the tech to something mundane
- Break down complex concepts into digestible chunks
- Include "Reality Check" boxes for common pitfalls
- Add "War Story" sidebars with real-world examples

### Engineering Ramblings
```yaml
---
title: "Why Do We Keep Reinventing the Wheel? üé°"
date: {{ .Date }}
draft: true
type: "posts"
categories: ["ramblings"]
tags: ["thoughts", "engineering-culture"]
description: "Musings on our collective inability to learn from history"
---
```

- Start with an observation or recent experience
- Include relevant memes or XKCD comics
- Mix technical insights with cultural observations
- End with open questions or calls for discussion

## Writing Style Guide

### Tone and Voice
- Be technically accurate but conversationally casual
- Use analogies that make complex topics relatable
- Include occasional pop culture references
- Add emojis strategically (but don't overdo it)
- Share personal failures/mistakes with humor

### Structure Elements
- Use subheadings as setup for jokes
- Include "TL;DR" sections with a twist
- Add "Plot Twist" or "Reality Check" boxes
- Use footnotes for extra snarky comments

### Code Examples
```go
// What you think the code does
func perfectlyGoodCode() {
    // Implementation details left as an exercise for the reader
    // (because I totally didn't forget how it works)
}

// What it actually does
func realityCheck() error {
    return errors.New("works on my machine ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø")
}
```

## Quick Start Templates

### "I Found a Bug" Template
```markdown
# The Day I Learned That [Technology] Hates Me

## The Setup
[Describe what you were trying to do, with excessive confidence]

## The Plot Twist
[What actually happened, with appropriate levels of surprise]

## The Investigation
[Your debugging journey, sprinkled with self-deprecating humor]

## The Solution
[What fixed it, and why you should have known better]

## Lessons Learned
1. Never trust [thing you trusted]
2. Always check [thing you didn't check]
3. Maybe read the docs next time
```

### "How-To Guide" Template
```markdown
# A Somewhat Reliable Guide to [Technology]

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of [technology]
- Patience (lots of it)
- Coffee (or preferred debugging beverage)
- A sense of humor (you'll need it)

## The Actually Important Parts
[Core technical content here]

## Common Pitfalls
(Or "How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Errors")

## Conclusion
[Wrap-up with a mix of genuine insight and humor]
```

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Technical accuracy maintained despite humor
- [ ] Code examples are actually runnable
- [ ] Analogies make sense and add value
- [ ] Humor enhances rather than obscures the point
- [ ] Personal experiences feel authentic
- [ ] Tone is consistent throughout
- [ ] Included at least one relevant meme/comic
- [ ] Added appropriate emojis (but not too many)
- [ ] Technical terms are explained or linked
- [ ] Proofread while caffeinated

## Writing Process
1. Start with a brain dump (don't edit yet!)
2. Organize into sections with funny headings
3. Add code examples and technical details
4. Sprinkle in humor and personal anecdotes
5. Edit for clarity (but keep the personality)
6. Add images, diagrams, and memes
7. Final review: Is it both useful AND entertaining?

Remember: If you're not slightly embarrassed about sharing your mistakes, you're probably not being honest enough. The best technical posts are both informative AND human.
